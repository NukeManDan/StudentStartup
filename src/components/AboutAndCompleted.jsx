            Shepardson needs a way to reduce waste so that we can decrease the

            Choices we make impact our personal health. According to our
            partners, students have daily opportunities to positively impact
            their personal health and wellness. Their choices impact themselves
            and those around them. How can we make a difference in the choices
            they make? Partners – CSU Prevention Research Center, Larimer County
            Sheriff’s office

            According to our partners, it is often challenging for residents in
            senior living facilities to find continued purpose in their lives.

            The City of Fort Collins needs to reach 20% renewable energy by
            2020, and we are currently at 16%. They want to increase the use of
            solar energy, but there are challenges and barriers. How can we
            create more use of solar energy under these constraints? Partner –
            City of Fort Collins Utilities
